The contents of this repo should be placed in .config/nvim/

coc-nvim-setup.pdf is a capture of a website I used to get default settings and debug.

All dependencies were installable from apt, including the following
- llvm
- clang 
- ccls
- nvim

A more up2date version of nodejs might be required; nvm helps install this
